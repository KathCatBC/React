React Homework Option 1


- Props
  Props is short for properties.
  They are part of a components configuration.
  They are immutable (cannot be changed) within the component.
  Props can change state, but should not be changed by state.
  Props can change the way the state is rendered.

- State
  Can be changed (mutable)
  Can be passed to a child component as a prop
  The state of an item is how it exists at any point in time/process.
  The state of an item can be altered by a component.


- Props & State examples:

  For a props/state example.  Let's consider my eyes.  They are hazel and my vision is not very good.

  I cannot change the color of my eyes (prop).  I can add colored contact lens (state).  This will make my eyes appear to be a different color (render) but have not changed the prop.

  I can also added glasses (change the state) this will render better vision - but will not change the prop of my vision.
